    Returns the details of a single room.

    # Return value

    A JSON object with keys:

    - `token` — The room token as used in a URL, e.g. `"sudoku"`.
    - `name` — The room name typically shown to users, e.g. `"Sodoku Solvers"`.
    - `description` — Text description of the room, e.g. `"All the best sodoku discussion!"`.
    - `info_updates` — Monotonic integer counter that increases whenever the room's metadata changes
    - `message_sequence` — Monotonic room post counter that increases each time a message is posted,
      edited, or deleted in this room.  (Note that changes to this field do *not* imply an update
      the room's `info_updates` value, nor vice versa).
    - `created` — Unix timestamp (as a float) of the room creation time.  Note that unlike earlier
      versions of SOGS, this is a proper seconds-since-epoch unix timestamp, not a javascript-style
      millisecond value.
    - `active_users` — Number of recently active users in the room over a recent time period (as
      given in the `active_users_cutoff` value).  Users are considered "active" if they have
      accessed the room (checking for new messages, etc.) at least once in the given period.
      **Note:** changes to this field do *not* update the room's `info_updates` value.
    - `active_users_cutoff` — The length of time (in seconds) of the `active_users` period.
      Defaults to a week (604800), but the open group administrator can configure it.
    - `image_id` — File ID of an uploaded file containing the room's image.  Omitted if there is no
      image.
    - `pinned_messages` — Array of pinned message information (omitted entirely if there are no
      pinned messages).  Each array element is an object with keys:
        * `id` — The numeric message id.
        * `pinned_at` — The unix timestamp when the message was pinned.
        * `pinned_by` — The session ID of the admin who pinned this message (which is not
          necessarily the same as the author of the message).
    - `moderators` — Array of Session IDs of the room's publicly viewable moderators.  This does not
      include room administrators nor hidden moderators.
    - `admins` — Array of Session IDs of the room's publicly viewable moderators.  This does not
      include room moderator nor hidden admins.
    - `hidden_moderators` — Array of Session IDs of the room's publicly hidden moderators.  This
      field is only included if the requesting user has moderator or admin permissions, and is
      omitted if empty.
    - `hidden_admins` — Array of Session IDs of the room's publicly hidden admins.  This field is
      only included if the requesting user has moderator or admin permissions, and is omitted if
      empty.
    - `default_read`, `default_accessible`, `default_write`, `default_upload` — These four boolean
      fields indicate whether new users have read, access, write, and upload permissions,
      respectively, in the room.  They are included in the response only if the requesting user has
      moderator or admin permissions.
    - `read`, `write`, `upload` — These three boolean flags indicate whether the **current** user
      has permission to read messages, write messages, or upload files to this room, respectively.
      (Accessibility is not included as being able to access the room information at all implies the
      room is accessible).
    - `moderator` — True if the current user has moderator permissions in the room, omitted
      otherwise.
    - `admin` — True if the current user has admin permissions in the room, omitted otherwise.  This
      is *not* exclusive of `moderator`: that is, an admin will have both `admin` and `moderator`
      set to true.
    - `global_moderator` — True if the current user is a global moderator.  This is not exclusive of
      `moderator`: a global moderator will have both flags set.
    - `global_admin` — True if the current user is a global admin.  This is *not* exclusive of
      `global_moderator`/`moderator`/`admin`: that is, a global admin will have all four set to
      true.

    # Access permissions

    The four access permissions control what a user can do in a room.  Users can have specific
    overrides (either true or false) applied for each room by moderators; if there are no such
    override then a user receives the room's `default_*` permission (e.g. `default_read`).  The
    meaning of each permission is as follows:

    - `read` — this allows a user to read messages posted in the room.
    - `write` — this allows users to post messages to the room.
    - `upload` — this allows users to upload attachments to the room (but only if `write` is also
      set).
    - `access` — this flag controls only applies when a user does *not* have `read` access: if this
      is true (which is the default for new rooms) then the user can still see information about the
      room such as its name, description, and user count, but cannot access the messages themselves.
      If this is *false* then the user does not have any access to the room at all and will receive
      a 404 Not Found error if attempting to access it (the same thing they would see if the room
      didn't exist).  This is provided to allow for "secret" rooms that only invited users may
      access (by setting both `default_accessible` and `default_write` to false).

    # Error status codes

    - 403 Forbidden — Returned if the current user does not have permission to access the room,
      e.g. because they are banned or the room permissions otherwise restrict access.

    - 404 Not Found — Returned if the room does not exist, or is configured as inaccessible (and
      this user doesn't have access).

    # Body

    This request takes a JSON object as request body containing the permissions to update; keys are
    as follows:

    - `accessible` — can be true or false to grant or revoke access to this room for the given
      session id when the session id does not have `read` access.  That is: a user with neither
      `read` nor `accessible` permissions cannot retrieve any information about the room and it will
      appear from the user's perspective that the room does not exist (i.e. attempting to access
      will receive Not Found errors).  Note that the `accessible` permission has no effect if the
      user has `read` access; clients should normally set both `"accessible": false, "read": false`
      together to revoke room access.

    - `read` — can be true or false to grant or revoke read permission for the given session id in
      this room.  If null or omitted the read permission is not changed.

    - `write` — can be true or false to grant or revoke write (i.e. posting) permissions for the
      given session id in this room.  If omitted the write permission is not changed.

    - `upload` — can be true or false to grant or revoke upload (i.e. attachment) permission for
      this given session id in this room.  Note that uploading *also* requires the `write`
      permission: setting this to true has no effect if the user doesn't also have `write`
      permission.

    - `default_accessible`, `default_read`, `default_write`, `default_upload` — these can be
      specified as true to remove the named user-specific permissions, restoring the user's
      permissions to the room's defaults.  It is an error to specify these as true when also
      specifying a non-null value for the non-default permission (e.g. `"read": true,
      "default_read": true`).

    - `unschedule` — if specified and set explicitly to `false` then do *not* unschedule future
      permission changes for each of the given `read`/`write`/`upload` values.  The default, when
      this is omitted or true, is to explicitly clear any scheduled future changes.  See the [future
      permissions endpoint](#post-roomroomfuturePermissionssid) for more details.

    # Return value

    On success this returns a JSON dict of the user's new room permissions (as would be returned for
    this session ID in the [GET `/room/ROOM/permissions` endpoint](#get-roomroompermissions), but
    with an additional key `session_id` indicating the session id to which the permissions were
    applied.

    Note that when blinding is enabled and this endpoint is called with an unblinded session ID, the
    returned `session_id` will be the *blinded* ID rather than the unblinded ID provided in the URL

def set_future_permissions(room, sid):
    """
    Scheduled future permission changes for this user in this room.

    This endpoint is typically combined with a permission change (i.e. in a [batch
    request](#post-batch)) to revert a permission change after a certain amount of time, for example
    to mute a user for 1 day.

    # Interaction with setting permissions

    There are typically two types of permission changes that are applied: a permanent change that
    applies until it is explicitly changed again; and a temporary change that should be revoked
    after a certain amount of time.

    ## Permanent permission restrictions

    The first case is implemented by a call to [permissions](#get-roomroompermissionssid), for
    example:

    ```json
    { "write": false }
    ```

    This call will revoke write permissions for the user in the room, and clear any future scheduled
    changes to the "write" permission for this user in this room.

    Similarly, a call such as

    ```json
    { "default_write": true }
    ```

    or

    ```json
    { "write": true }
    ```

    would clear any scheduled "write" permission changes and return the user's permissions to the
    room's default, or explicitly grant write access, respectively.

    If specifying multiple permissions such as:

    ```json
    { "read": true, "write": true, "upload": true }
    ```

    then any scheduled changes for *each* of the given permissions will be cleared.

    ## Temporary permission changes

    To assign a temporary permission change such as restricting write access for 1 day the moderator
    client is expected to first schedule the "permanent" permission change (as described above) and
    immediately follow it by a call to this endpoint.  (Typically these will be bundled into a
    single [batch sequence](#post-sequence) request).

    In effect, the first subrequest then clears any schedule future changes, the the second
    subrequest (to this endpoint) schedules a new future change.  For example, to restrict a user's
    posting permission for 1 day, you would issue a batch request where the first subrequest posts
    to the `permissions` endpoint containing:

    ```json
    { "write": false }
    ```

    and the second subrequest posts to this endpoint (`futurePermissions`) containing:

    ```json
    { "write": true, "in": 86400 }
    ```

    A more complex example would be to apply a restriction that: revokes read access for 1 day,
    revokes write access for 1 week, and revokes upload access permanently.  This would use three
    subrequests:

    `POST /room/ROOMID/permissions/SESSIONID`:

    ```json
    { "read": false, "write": false, "upload": false }
    ```

    `POST /room/ROOMID/futurePermissions/SESSIONID`:

    ```json
    { "write": true, "in": 604800 }
    ```

    `POST /room/ROOMID/futurePermissions/SESSIONID`:

    ```json
    { "read": true, "in": 86400 }
    ```

    ## Permission races

    If two moderators submit different permission changes at (approximately) the same time then
    there is no specific attempt to detect or merge the changes: instead what happens is that the
    later received change takes effect.  For example, if moderator one decides to revoke write
    permissions permanently, and moderator two decides to revoke read and write permissions for 1
    week then the result will be the order in which the requests are received:

    - if moderator 2's request is received after moderator 1's then the result will be revoked read
      and write permissions that are restored after 1 week.

    - if moderator 1's request is received after moderator 2's then the scheduled write permission
      restoration will be removed, and the user will end up with read permissions revoked for a week
      (because moderator 1 did not touch the read permission) and write permissions revoked
      permanently.

    ## More complex scheduling

    In some complex cases it may be that a client wants to change current permissions *without*
    removing currently scheduled changes.  For this purpose the `permission` endpoint allows
    specifying `"unschedule": false` to explicitly avoid clearing scheduled changes for the affected
    permissions.

    For example, suppose a write permission has been revoked and scheduled to be restored in 1 day,
    then a temporary exception to the ban can be scheduled using:

    `POST /room/ROOMID/permissions/SESSIONID`:

    ```json
    { "write": true, "unschedule": false }
    ```

    `POST /room/ROOMID/futurePermissions/SESSIONID`:

    ```json
    { "write": false, "in": 3600 }
    ```

    This would effect a current change that grants the write permission, revokes it after 1 hour,
    without removing the change to restore it after a day.  (Alternatively you can omit the first
    call to permissions to add a future change without changing the current permission at all).

    There is no limit to the number of permission changes that can be scheduled this way, but note
    that many conflicting scheduled changes can have unexpected, complex effects and so this should
    only be used with care and careful consideration.

    This sort of multi-scheduled changes is *not* expected to be needed in most cases; clients can
    likely ignore this complexity without a noticeable loss in functionality.

    # Body

    This request takes a JSON object containing the following keys:

    - `read`, `write`, `upload` — one or more of these must be specified with a true or false value
      to apply the permission change at the scheduled time.  A null or omitted value indicates not
      to schedule a permission change for the permission.  At least one of these keys must be
      provided with a true or false value.

    - `in` — how long from now, in seconds, this permission change should take effect.  This field
      is required, must be positive, and must be less than 1 billion (to detect accidentally passing
      in a unix timestamp rather than a duration).  Note that permission changes are processed every
      10 seconds, so the actual change may be delayed up to 10s beyond the scheduled time.

    # Return value

    This call returns a JSON list containing all currently scheduled permission changes for this
    user, as would be returned by the [get future permissions](#get-roomroomfuturePermissions)
    endpoint, but only including changes for this user.

    Note that when blinding is enabled and an unblinded id is given, any permission changes will be
    scheduled against the *blinded* Session ID, if known, rather than the unblinded id.

    Polls a room for metadata updates.

    The endpoint polls room metadata for this room, always including the instantaneous room details
    (such as the user's permission and current number of active users), and including the full room
    metadata if the room's info_updated counter has changed from the provided value.

    # URL Parameters

    - `info_updated` — The client's currently cached `info_updates` value for the room.  The full
      room metadata is returned in the response if and only if the room's last update count does not
      equal the given value.

    # Return value

    On success this returns the results of polling the room for updated information.  This endpoint
    always returns ephemeral data, such as the number of active users and the current user's
    permissions, and will include the full room details if and only if it has changed (i.e.
    info_updates does not match) from the `info_updated` value provided by the requestor.

    Note that the `details` field is only present and populated if the room's `info_updates` counter
    differs from the provided `info_updated` value; otherwise the values are unchanged and so it is
    omitted.

    The return value is a JSON object containing the following subset of values of [the full room
    details](#get-roomroom):

    - `token`
    - `active_users`
    - `read`, `write`, `upload`

    updating the room image or pinned messages whenever the `details` field is not included in the

def upload_file(room):
    """
    Uploads a file to a room.

    Takes the request as binary in the body and takes other properties (specifically the suggested
    filename) via submitted headers.

    The user must have upload and posting permissions for the room.  The file will have a default
    lifetime of 1 hour, which is extended to 15 days (by default) when a post referencing the
    uploaded file is posted or edited.

    # URL Parameters

    # Body

    The body of the request is the raw bytes that make up the attachment body.

    # Header parameters

    ## Content-Type

    This should be set to application/octet-stream.  If the client has a strong reason to use
    another content type then it may do so, but it is acceptable to always use
    `application/octet-stream`.

    ## Content-Disposition

    The attachment filename should be provided via the `Content-Disposition` header of the request,
    encoded as URI-encoded UTF-8 as per RFC 5987.  Specifically, it should be formatted as:

        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''filename.txt

    where `filename.txt` is a utf-8 byte sequence with any bytes not in the following list encoded
    using %xx URI-style encoding.

    Non-encoded ascii characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !, #, $, &, +, -, ., ^, _, `, |, ~.  All other
    characters shall be represented as their utf-8 byte sequence.

    For instance, a file named `my 🎂.txt` (🎂 = U+1F382, with utf-8 representation 0xF0 0x9F 0x8E
    0x82) should specify the filename in the header as:

        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''my%20%f0%9f%8e%82.txt

    Filenames are not required as they are not always available (such as when uploading a pasted
    image) but should be used when possible.

    The filename, if provided, will be provided in the same format in the download header for the
    file.
