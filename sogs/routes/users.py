def set_mod(sid):
    """
    Appoints or removes a moderator or admin.

    This endpoint is used to appoint or remove moderator/admin permissions either for specific rooms
    or for server-wide global moderator permissions.

    Admins/moderators of rooms can only be appointed or removed by a user who has admin permissions
    in the room (including global admins).  Global admins/moderators may only be appointed by a
    global admin.

    # Body Parameters

    Takes a JSON object as body with the following keys:

    - `rooms` — List of one or more room tokens to which the moderator status should be applied. The
      invoking user must be an admin of all of the given rooms.

        This may be set to the single-element list `["*"]` to add or remove the moderator from all
        rooms in which the current user has admin permissions (the call will succeed if the calling
        user is an admin in at least one room).

        Exclusive of `global`.

    - `global` — boolean value: if true then apply the change at the server-wide global level: the
      user will be added/removed as a global moderator/admin.  The invoking user must be a global
      admin in order to control global mods/admins.

        Exclusive of `rooms`.

    - `moderator` — optional boolean value indicating that this user should have moderator
      permissions added (`true`), removed (`false`), or left alone (omitted or `null`).  At least
      one non-null value of `moderator` or `admin` must be provided.

    - `visible` — boolean specifying whether the moderator/admin should be made publicly visible as
      a moderator/admin of the room(s) (if `true`) or hidden (`false`).  Hidden moderators/admins
      still have all the same permissions as visible moderators/admins, but are visible only to
      other moderators/admins; regular users in the room will not know their moderator status.

        The default behaviour if this field is omitted (or `null`) is to make the moderator visible
        when adding as a room moderator/admin, and hidden if adding as a global moderator/admin.

    - `admin` — boolean value indicating that this user should have admin permissions added
      (`true`), removed (`false`), or left alone (omitted or `null`).  Note that granting admin
      permission automatically includes granting moderator permission, and thus it is an error to
      use `admin=true` with `moderator=false`.

    The request must include exactly one non-null value of `rooms` and `global`, and at least one
    non-null value of `moderator` and `admin`.

    Different combinations of `moderator` and `admin` true/false/omitted values interact as follows
    (note that an omitted value and an explicit `null` value are equivalent):

    - `admin=true` — Adds admin permissions (and, implicitly, moderator permissions).
    - `admin=true`, `moderator=true` — Same as above (adds admin permission).
    - `admin=false`, `moderator=true` — Removes admin permission, if present, and assigns moderator
      permission.  This both demotes an admin to a moderator, and promotes a non-moderator to a
      moderator.
    - `admin=false`, — Removes admin permission, if present, but leaves moderator permissions alone.
      This effectively "demotes" the user from admin to moderator, but will not promote a
      non-moderator/admin to a moderator.
    - `moderator=true` — Adds moderator permissions.  If admin permission is already present, it
      remains in effect.
    - `moderator=false` — Removes moderator **and admin** permissions, if present.
    - `moderator=false`, `admin=false` — Same as above (removes both).
    - `admin=true`, `moderator=false` — Error: because admin implies moderator, this is impossible
      to fulfill.
    - both null — Error: at least one must have a non-null value.

    If an admin or moderator has both global and room-specific moderation permissions then their
    actual moderator status will be taken as the greater of the two.  That is, they will have room
    admin permissions if listed as an admin of *either* the room or global server.

    Visibility, however, is determined by the room-specific visibility setting, regardless of the
    global setting.  (So, for example, a hidden global admin with moderator powers in a room will
    appears as a visible admin of the room, and a global visible admin listed as a room hidden
    moderator will be effectively a hidden admin of the room).

    # Return value

    On success returns a 200 status code with JSON object as body containing keys:

    - "info_updates": this is an object where each key is a room token, and each value is that
      room's new `info_updates` value.  For a request making changes to room-level mods (i.e. using
      the `rooms` parameter) this will be the new `info_updates` value for each of the given rooms.
      For global moderator changes this will contain the new info_updates value of *all* rooms on
      the server (because all rooms are updated when a global mod is added/removed).

      These values can be useful to track whether possibly-concurrent room polling requests are
      expected to have the moderator changes applied yet.

    # Error status codes

    400 Bad Request — if invalid parameters (or parameter combinations) are provided, such as an
    empty room list, or not specifying either moderator or admin parameters.

    403 Forbidden — if the invoking user does not have admin access to all of the given `rooms` (or,
    for a global moderator request, is not a global admin).

    404 Not Found — if one or more of the given `rooms` tokens do not exist.
