    """
    Handles a decrypted v4 onion request; this injects a subrequest to process it then returns the
    result of that subrequest.  In contrast to v3, it is more efficient (particularly for binary
    input or output) and allows using endpoints that return headers or bodies with non-2xx response
    codes.

    Message (request) components:

    "endpoint" - the omq endpoint
    "query" - the request query
    "pubkey" - pk of client making request
    "params" - a json value to dump as the the query parameters

        Example:
            full request: `omq.endpoint('some_endpoint', 'room.messages_since', jvi0grsj3029fjwhatever, {'Room:room', 'int:seqno'})`
                endpoint: 'some_endpoint'
