# Authentication handling for incoming requests.

# We handle authentication through 4 headers included in the outermost request (e.g. which typically
# means the onion request):
#
# X-SOGS-Pubkey -- Ed25519 pubkey of the user.  If blinded, this starts with "15" and the pubkey is
# the user's blinded session id on the SOGS.  If *unblinded* this starts with "00", the remainder is
# an Ed25519 pubkey, and we convert it to an X25519 pubkey to determine the user's 05... session id.
#
# X-SOGS-Nonce -- a unique 128-bit (16 byte) request nonce, encoded in either base64 (22 chars (or
# 24 with optional padding)) or hex (32 characters).  This nonce may not be reused with this pubkey
# (within a reasonable time frame) and so should be randomly generated for each request.
#
# X-SOGS-Timestamp -- unix integer timestamp, expressed in the usual human (base 10) notation.  The
# timestamp must be with ¬±24 hours of the SOGS server time when the request is received.
#
# X-SOGS-Signature -- Ed25519 signature (passed in base64 encoding) of:
#
#       SERVER_PUBKEY || NONCE || TIMESTAMP || METHOD || PATH || HBODY
#
# where HBODY is 64-byte blake2b hash of the body *if* the request has a non-empty body, and is
# empty (omitted) otherwise.
#
# This value is signed using the blinded or unblinded Ed25519 pubkey given in the -Pubkey header.
#
# For example, for a GET request to '/capabilities?required=sogs' to a server with pubkey
# fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210 the request headers could be:
#
# X-SOGS-Pubkey: 150123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
# X-SOGS-Nonce: IYUVSYbLlTgmnigr/H3Tdg==
# X-SOGS-Timestamp: 1642079887
# X-SOGS-Signature: ...
#
# Where ... is the 88-character (including 2 padding chars) base64 encoding of the 64-byte value
# obtained by signing:
#
# b'xxx...xxxYYY...YYY1642079887GET/capabilities?required=sogs'

#
# For batch requests the X-SOGS-* headers are applied once, on the outermost batch request, *not* on
# the individual subrequests; the authorization applies to all subrequests.
#
# If `PATH` contains URL-encoded characters then the signature applies to the post-decoded value,
# e.g. a request for `GET /foo/%F0%9F%8D%8D%20%20%20%f0%9f%8d%8c` would expect the PATH component in
# the signature to be the utf8-encoded bytes of `/foo/üçç   üçå`.  (This is unfortunately necessary
# because HTTP request URL encoding rules are non-unique and could get converted between equivalent
# representations in transit).  If passing through an *onion request* then you may optionally avoid
# URL-encoding entirely: the endpoint of the onion request explicitly allows raw utf-8 characters in
# the path.  For direct requests, however, you should use the raw unicode value in the signature,
# but URL-encode the value in the actual HTTP request path.
#
# NB: legacy sogs endpoints (that is: endpoint paths without a leading /) require specifying the
# path in the signature message as `/legacy/whatever` even if just `whatever` is being used in the
# onion request "endpoint" parameter).
