    Rename rooms.updates/messages.updated to rooms.message_sequence/messages.seqno for better
    disambiguation with rooms.info_updates.

    This also does various other changes/fixes that came at the same time as the column rename:

    - remove "updated" from and add "pinned_by"/"pinned_at" to pinned_messages
    - recreate the pinned_messages table and triggers because we need several changes:
        - add trigger to unpin a message when the message is deleted
        - remove "updates" (now message_sequence) updates from room metadata update trigger
        - add AFTER UPDATE trigger to properly update room metadata counter when re-pinning an
          existing pinned message
    - fix user_permissions view to return true for read/write/upload to true for moderators
